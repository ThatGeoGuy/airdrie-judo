			<h1 class='content-head'>About Our Club</h1>
			<p>The Airdrie Judo Club is a long-standing and well-established Judo club in Alberta. Year after year we send and help fund a multitude of local students to participate in competitions at the provincial, national, and international levels. However, while tournaments and competition have become a big part of Judo, we still like to focus on more than just fighting. Here, we try to promote both self-improvement and acheivement in our students. Outside of competitions, some of the underspoken benefits of Judo are better health, weight management, building (and increasing) strength, learning self-defense techniques, bully proofing and prevention, and most importantly an increased sense of self-confidence.</p>
			<p>With several skilled instructors, we run a variety of classes for practically any age category. Judo is for everyone, and is practiced by people from every walk of life in Alberta, in Canada, and around the world.</p>

A fun mix of Judo games, Judo specific, and non-specific exercises are used to develop balance, coordination, self-awareness, and awareness of others, all while laying the fundamentals to start developing Judo specific skills once they are old enough for the junior class. While we accept 4 year olds into this class, it is preferred that they be enrolled in preschool to assist with the concept of a classroom environment.</dd>

				<p>A typical session will start and end with a formal bow. The students line up opposite the sensei (instructors), and bow in a kneeling position. This is a traditional formality and is done as a sign of respect, from the students towards the instructors for what they learn, and from the instructors to the students for their time and attention.</p>
				<p>This is followed by a warm up that will be specific to the planned session. Warming up prepares the body for action, and incorporates movements that the students will be practicing throughout the session. Afterwards, we follow this with breakfall practice (ukemi). To break one's fall is to be able to land safely without injury after falling or being thrown.</p>
				<p>We continue with directed instruction and free practice, as well as as specific training drills to reinforce the skills required for Judo. Finally, our practices conclude with a cool down, a check for well-being, notices, and another formal bow.</p>
