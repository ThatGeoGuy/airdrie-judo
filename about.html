      <h1 class='content-head'>About Our Club</h1>
      <p>
        The Airdrie Judo Club is a long-standing and well-established Judo club
        in Alberta. Year after year we send and help fund a multitude of local
        students to participate in competitions at the provincial, national, and
        international levels. However, while tournaments and competition have
        become a big part of Judo, we still like to focus on more than just
        fighting. Here, we try to promote both self-improvement and acheivement in
        our students. Outside of competitions, some of the underspoken benefits of
        Judo are better health, weight management, building (and increasing)
        strength, learning self-defense techniques, bully proofing and prevention,
        and most importantly an increased sense of self-confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        With several skilled instructors, we run a variety of classes for
        practically any age category. Judo is for everyone, and is practiced by
        people from every walk of life in Alberta, Canada, and around the
        world.

        <h3 class='content-subhead'>Pre-Judo <em>(Age 4*-6)</em></h3>
        <p>
          Pre-Judo is one of the first steps an individual can take to be
          introduced to the Olympic sport of Judo. This class focuses on the
          principles of Judo taught in a fun and relaxed environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          A mix of fun Judo games, judo specific and non-specific exercises with
          interactive drills are used to develop overall body control incluing
          balance, coordination, faster reflexes, self-awareness, and awareness
          of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the other benefits of participating in Judo are developing
          self-confidence, discipline, self-esteem, and the respect for oneself
          and others, while creating role models for our families, friends and
          our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Judo is a great physical exercise that is safe and promotes strength,
          power, agility and flexibility while instilling concentration and a
          sharp mind!
        </p>
        <p>
          Pre-Judo starts to lay the groundwork for developing Judo specific
          skills once they are old enough for the Recreational Junior class.
          These classes are limited in size, so be sure to register early to
          reserve a spot.
        </p>
        <p class='footnote'>
          * Although we accept 4 year olds, we prefer they be enrolled in
          preschool, to help with the concept of a classroom environment.

      <div class='class-description pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 pure-u-lrg-1-2'>
        <h3 class='content-subhead'>Recreational Juniors <em>(Age 7-11)</em></h3>
        <p>
          The recreational class picks up where Pre-Judo leaves off, with a
          large focus on the basic techniques and principles of Judo. The class
          retains a fun and relaxed environment, but has a larger focus on
          understanding the nature and spirit of Judo, from a foundational
          level.
        </p>
        <p>
          This class also retains a mix of games and Judo-specific and
          non-specific exercises, with slightly elevated activity levels, as the
          class runs longer than Pre-Judo. For students who have never tried
          Judo before, and are too old for Pre-Judo, this is the class we
          recommend to start them off until they grasp the basics.
        </p>
        <p>
          This class, like Pre-Judo, has a limited number of spots available,
          however, you can register for this class at any time, even outside our
          regular registration schedule.
        </p>

        <h3 class='content-subhead'>Junior Competitive Program <em>(Age 8-11)</em></h3>
        <p>
          The junior competitive program is for our higher level athletes, who
          have already demonstrated their knowledge of breakfalls and basic
          techniques. This class ramps up in intensity from the recreational
          judo class, and is aimed for athletes who wish to compete at the
          provincial and national levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students in this class can expect to travel and compete when the
          opportunity arises, against other athletes from across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike Pre-Judo and the Recreational class, there is no limit to this class size,
          however for new registrations we usually ask that students attend the
          recreational class while they get acquainted with the art.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class='pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 pure-u-lrg-1-2'>
        <h3 class='content-subhead'>Seniors Competitive Class <em>(Age 12+)</em></h3>
        <p>
          The seniors class is a competitive program for students who have been
          immersed in Judo, and want to continue to the next level. The class
          combines strength training, circuits, sparring, and technical
          instruction for athletes who want to compete at provincial and
          national levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the seniors class, students can expect to travel and compete at
          provincial and national tournaments, as well as attend provincial and
          national training camps. Like the Junior Competitive class, there is no
          limit to the number of students in this class.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seniors class will run four times a week, with two classes
          focusing on <em>technical & circuit training</em>, and two classes
          devoted to <em>randori (sparring / free-practice) & weight
          training</em>. Our club has our own weight room and plenty of
          equipment, and athletes will be instructed on how to use the equipment
          safely and effectively.

        <p>
          A typical session will start and end with a formal bow. The students
          line up opposite the sensei (instructors), and bow in a kneeling
          position. This is a traditional formality and is done as a sign of
          respect, from the students towards the instructors for what they learn,
          and from the instructors to the students for their time and
          attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is followed by a warm up that will be specific to the planned
          session. Warming up prepares the body for action, and incorporates
          movements that the students will be practicing throughout the session.
          Afterwards, we follow this with breakfall practice (ukemi). To break
          one's fall is to be able to land safely without injury after falling or
          being thrown.
        </p>
        <p>
          We continue with directed instruction and free practice, as well as
          as specific training drills to reinforce the skills required for Judo.
          Finally, our practices conclude with a cool down, a check for
          well-being, notices, and another formal bow.
