Hey everyone, tonight is the last practice for the Juniors before we break for
the summer, so please try to show up tonight if possible. Sensei Trevor should
make it back from Lethbridge tonight, so it's a good opportunity to see him
before judo is over.

Other than that, we all hope you have a great summer, and we hope to see you
all back when we start up again in September. Also bear in mind that nationals
is held here in Calgary this year, and will be from May 12th to 15th at the
Olympic Oval. Come out and cheer on our athletes and see what higher level judo
is all about! For more info, you can check out Judo Alberta's [National Championships Page](http://www.judoalberta.com/index.php/national-championships/).
