## The dojo has re-opened

We are happy to announce that the cleanup in the dojo has completed, and we are
now open again for practice! We will be holding open practices (all ages) on
Mondays and Wednesdays from 6:30PM until 8:00PM. Practices will start Monday
December 5th, and will go until Wednesday December 21st, after which we will
take a break for the holidays.

Semester two classes will start back up on Monday January 9th. Registration for
our second semester will be on January 16th and 18th, so be sure to mark the
date. See our
