Registration for term 2 is now open! We are extremely interested in knowing how many students
we will have next semester, so please let us know as soon as possible if you plan to register.
If you're new to the club and want to register, [contact us]({{ site.baseurl}}/contact) or fill
out our [registration form]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/registration-form-2015-2016.pdf) and bring
it to the club. Term 2 will go from January 6th until May 16th, so try to register early as
space will be limited.

Hope to see you all next year!
