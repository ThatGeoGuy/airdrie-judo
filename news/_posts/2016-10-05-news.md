## Plainsmen Closure & Tonights Practice

Unfortunately, there was a leak in the boys washroom in the Plainsmen Arena that
was noticed on Tuesday, October 4th, 2016. The Plainsman arena will be closed
until further notice due to the water damage caused from the leak in the boys
washroom. Hopefully this issue can be rectified soon so the Plainsman doors can
be reopen for all to use. In the meantime, we have cancelled practice at the
dojo.

Sorry for any inconvenience. We will try to provide updates when possible.
