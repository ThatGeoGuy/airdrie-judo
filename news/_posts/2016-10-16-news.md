## Dojo Closed & Letter to Membership

For those of you who were unable to attend our emergency meeting on the 13th,
Sensei Paul has written a letter summarizing the incident, status of the club,
and future options for the semester. The letter can be found [here]({{
site.baseurl }}/pub/Letter-to-membership_2016-10.pdf). Please read it over and
do not hesitate to [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) if you have any
more questions.
