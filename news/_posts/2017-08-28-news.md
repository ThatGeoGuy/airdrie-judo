## AirdrieFest 2017 and Fall Registration

Hello fellow Airdrie Judo Club members,

As summer comes to a close, we are approaching the beginning of our next
semester. Here's a couple of updates to where you can find us before we get
started back up again in September:

### AirdrieFest 2017

We will be at AirdrieFest again this year, so come check out the club's booth
and get your registration done early! If you've never been to the Airdrie Judo
club before and want to know what Judo is all about, we will have information
packages available and will be answering questions.

Date
 : Saturday, September 9th, 2017 from 11:00AM to 4:00PM

Location
 : Outside of City Hall<br>
   400 Main Street South,<br>
   Airdrie, AB,<br>

### Fall Registration

If you can't make it to AirdrieFest, then don't worry, you can still register
for the fall semester. We will be having open registration the week afterwards,
at the Airdrie Judo club. Full information can be found below:

Date
