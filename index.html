				<h1 class='content-head'>What is Judo?</h1>
				<p>Judo is a martial art and olympic sport invented in 1882, that has deep philosophical roots which extend to the core of the art. Even the name judo, which translates from Japanese to "<em>the Gentle Way</em>," embodies the idea that we can defeat any obstacle by taking the path of least resistance. Some core tenets of the philosophy of judo are <em>Maximum Efficiency</em> and <em>Mutual Prosperity</em>.</p>
				<p>Nowadays, Judo is a competitive sport that is practiced world-wide, from children in the dojo to fierce athletes at international competitions, such as the Olympics. Anyone can learn from the techniques of Judo, regardless of age, size, or gender. Judo is an inexpensive, year-round activity that appeals to all walks of life; even for those not interested in competition, Judo is an excellent recreational sport that can stimulate the mind and improve your physical health while promoting positive moral values, self-esteem, self-confidence, and overall well-being.</p>
