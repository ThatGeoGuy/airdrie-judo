        <h1 class='content-head'>What is Judo?</h1>
        <p>
          Judo is a martial art that was founded in 1882 by Dr. Jigoro Kano in
          Japan. It is a lifelong sport for all ages and people, and is an
          Olympic sport since 1964. Judo translated means <em>The Gentle
            Way</em>, referring to the way techniques use an opponent's motion
          (force) and strength against
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Judo consists of two main parts: throwing (tachi-waza) and ground
          work (ne-waza). The two guiding principles of Judo are "Maximum
          efficient use of energy" and "Mutual welfare and benefit towards all".
